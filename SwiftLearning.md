var - It is used for the variables. We can change the value once its initialized.
let - It is used for the constants. Once initialized we cannot change its value.

Booleans Type : It can have only 2 values i.e. True or False. Example:
**let trueValue = true
let falseValue = false**

**let passingGrade = 50
let studentGrade = 74
let studentPassed = studentGrade > passingGrade**

Comparison operator - Used to compare 2 values.
**let samGrade = 49
let chrisGrade = 99
samGrade == chrisGrade
samGrade != chrisGrade**

Logical Operator:
1. NOT operator - Returrns the inverse of the bool value. !
2. AND operator - &&. Returns true if both the operands are true else it will return false.
3. OR operator -  Return true if any one of the operand is true. ||

IF-ELSE : It is used to execute a set of statements based on some condition :
**if studentPassed {
    print("Congrats")
}else{
    print("Keep studying")
}**

Ternary Operator : Here an expression is checked. Then value is set based on that.
**let betterStudent = studentPassed ? "YES":"NO"**

Optionals: Marking a type as options represents that it can have value or cannot have a value. 
**let betterStudent = studentPassed ? "YES":"NO"


Dictionary:
It is an unordered collection type. It stores the data in key value pair. keys in the dictionary should be unique.
**var emptyDictionary : [String:Int] = [:]
var namesAndPet = ["a":"A","b":"B"]**

Iterating through dictionary values:
**for (keyInfo,valueInfo) in namesAndPet {
    print("key is :\(keyInfo) and value is : \(valueInfo)")
}**


var petName:String?
petName = "Mango"
print(petName)**

Forced unwrapping optional:
**print(petName!)** - This is not a recomended way to unwrap the optionals as it may lead to crash the app in case the petName is nil. 
Use forced unwrapping only if you know the option is having a value.

Optional Binding: - Way to safely unwrap the optional.
**if let petName = petName {
    print("Name of the pet is \(petName)")
}**

Nil Coalescing Operator:
It is used to unwrap the optional. In case the value of optional returns nil then it will return a default value. For ex :
**let optionalInt : Int? = nil
let requiredInt = optionalInt ?? 0**

Collections:
Tuples: In iOS we can store the related data as a single unit using Tuples. For example in case to store the location we need to store both longitude and latitude.
**let location : (lat:CGFloat,long:CGFloat) = (100.0,200.0)
location.lat
location.long**
Now this constant is having 2 pieces of information.
**let (anotherLocLat,anotherLocLong) = location
anotherLocLat
anotherLocLong**

Arrays:
It is used to store the elements of same type.
These are ordered type.Each element in array can be accessed using index.
**let pastries : [String] = ["cookie","cupcake","donut"]**

**var pastriesVar : [String] = []
pastriesVar.append("abcd")
pastriesVar.append("gggg")**

We can fetch the elements from an array using the index.
**pastriesVar[0]**

Different operations on array :
1. count - To get the count of the array
2. isEmpty - Check if array is empty
3. contains - Check if array contains a particular element or no

Control Flows:
while Loop : Here a set of statements are executed till a condition evalutes to true. Here condition is evaluated first and if its true then set of statements are executed.
**var index = 1
while index < 10 {
    print(index)
    index += 1
}
**

Repeat while example: It is going to execute the statement at least once. Here condition is evaluated after statements are executed.
**index = 1
repeat {
    print(index)
    index += 1
}while(index<10)**

For Loop: Here we are executing a set of statement for particular number of times.
**for i in 0...5 {
    print(i)
}
**
**for _ in 0...5 {
    print("testing")
}**

Iterating over collection:
For loop can be used to iterate over a collection.
**let days = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"]
for day in days {
    print(day)
}**

break : We can use break statement to exit from the loop based on some condition.
**let days = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"]
for day in days {
    if day == "Thursday" {
        break
    }
    print(day)
}**
continue : If we dont want to execute some statement for some elements while iterating the collection we can use continue.
**let days = ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"]
for day in days {
    if day == "Thursday" {
        continue
    }
    print(day)
}**

Sets: It is unordered collection of values with same data type. It contains the unique value. We can compare the different sets.
**var setObj : Set<Int> = [1,2,3,4,5,1]
print(setObj)
setObj.contains(3)
setObj.contains(444)
setObj.count
setObj.insert(333)
print(setObj)**
    

1. Named Types and Compund Types
 Named Types : Classes , Structure, Enum and protocol
 Compund Types : Tuples, Functions.
2. Reference and Value types

Function : 
Functions in swift perform some task. It can reused across app by calling it thus avoiding the duplication.
**func sayHello() {
    print("Hello !!!")
}
sayHello()**
Functions with parameters:
**func sayHello(msg:String) {
    print(msg)
}
sayHello(msg: "Hello Everyone !!!")**

We can also set the default values for the function parameter.

Function returning a value:
**func sayHelloMessageFunction(msg:String) -> String {
    return "Hello \(msg)"
}
print(sayHelloMessageFunction(msg: "Peter"))**
